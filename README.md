## Give it a test!

If you want to test it out first hand, try it here: [https://redisred.herokuapp.com/admin](https://redisred.herokuapp.com/admin)

Username: `admin`
Password: `testing`

## Features

### Randos

- Visitors can go to `/whatever`, and they'll be redirected to link named `whatever`
- If the link doesn't exist, they'll be presented with a nice 404 page :)
- Visiting just `/` brings you to a designated root redirect.

### Admins

- `/admin` brings people to page where they can sign in with Google OAuth
- `/admin/redirects` lets people view and edit all of the redirects

### API

All requests must be authenticated with a `x-access-token` header.

- `GET /admin/api/` returns a json of all the redirects
- `POST /admin/api/create` creates a redirect with parameters `key` and `url`
- `POST /admin/api/delete` deletes a redirect with parameter `key`
